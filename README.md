# Virtual-Machine-Project-

A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs in an isolated environment on top of a host system, allowing users to operate multiple operating systems and applications independently on a single physical device.

üîç Key Characteristics

Isolation: Each VM runs separately, preventing interference with other VMs or the host

Hardware Emulation: It mimics CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces

Operating System Independence: You can run Windows on a Linux host, or vice versa

Snapshots & Cloning: Easily save states or duplicate setups

‚öôÔ∏è Components of a VM Environment

Hypervisor: The layer that manages and runs VMs on the host system

Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V)

Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on top of a traditional OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

Guest OS: The operating system installed inside the VM

Virtual Disk: Acts like a hard drive, stored as a file on the host

Virtual Network Adapter: Enables network connectivity between the VM and other devices
